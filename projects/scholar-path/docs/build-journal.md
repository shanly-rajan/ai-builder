# ScholarPath Build Journal

This append-only journal records the objective, implementation evidence, and remaining
debt for each independently committed milestone.

## Milestone 0001: Standing engineering contract

**Date:** 2026-08-28

### Milestone objective

Establish a project-scoped ScholarPath engineering contract, prompt archive, build
journal, and ignore boundary for incremental, test-gated delivery without committing
local environments, secrets, caches, private data, or generated artifacts.

### Prompt used

[`docs/prompts/0001-standing-engineering-contract.md`](prompts/0001-standing-engineering-contract.md)

### Files changed

- `projects/scholar-path/AGENTS.md`
- `projects/scholar-path/.gitignore`
- `projects/scholar-path/docs/prompts/0001-standing-engineering-contract.md`
- `projects/scholar-path/docs/build-journal.md`
- `projects/scholar-path/tests/__init__.py`
- `projects/scholar-path/tests/contract/__init__.py`
- `projects/scholar-path/tests/contract/test_engineering_contract.py`

### Tests added

- Contract test that checks the standing prompt contains the critical terminology,
  deterministic-processing, provenance, safety, approval, and audit guardrails.
- Contract test that checks the prompt archive and build journal exist.
- Contract test that checks every required build-journal section is present.
- Contract placement test that requires `AGENTS.md` inside ScholarPath and rejects a
  repository-root copy.
- Ignore-policy contract test covering local environments, secrets, Python caches,
  private data, generated artifacts, logs, and local databases.

### Test results

- `venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -v`:
  5 tests passed after the milestone amendment.
- `venv/bin/python -m compileall -q tests`: passed.
- Ruff format check: 3 files already formatted.
- Ruff lint check: all checks passed.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- `git check-ignore -v --no-index ...`: project-local rules matched `venv/`,
  `.venv/`, `.env`, `.ruff_cache/`, `data/private/`, and `*.sqlite3` paths.
- `git ls-files projects/scholar-path/venv`: returned no tracked files.
- The first test-discovery attempt found zero tests. Package markers were added and
  the same discovery command then found and passed the contract tests.
- A dedicated type checker is not configured and no production code exists in this
  milestone; configuring one remains explicit debt rather than an implicit tool choice.

### Assumptions

- Because this is a monorepo, ScholarPath's contract, prompt history, journal, and
  ignore policy belong inside `projects/scholar-path/` so they do not govern sibling
  experiments.
- Python's standard-library `unittest` is sufficient for this documentation-only
  milestone; choosing and installing the application test toolchain is deferred.
- Prompt archival begins with the milestone that introduced the archival rule; earlier
  conversation prompts are already represented by the committed project README.
- "Not meant to be committed" means ignored and untracked, not deleted from the
  developer's machine. The existing virtual environment remains locally available.
- `.env.example`, curated sample data, dependency lock files, and source-controlled
  evaluation fixtures must remain committable.
- The contract relocation was committed as `130a9a4`; shared history is preserved
  rather than rewritten or force-pushed as part of this documentation amendment.

### Lessons learned

- Agent responsibilities and six external platform integrations are already distinct
  in the project context, so future milestones can test those boundaries independently.
- Governance requirements are more reliable when their critical invariants are
  executable contract tests rather than documentation alone.
- Directory placement is an architectural scope boundary for repository instructions.
- Ignore behavior should be verified through Git itself as well as by checking the
  documented patterns.

### Remaining debt

- Select and configure the ScholarPath Python environment, formatter, linter, type
  checker, and primary test runner in a dedicated future milestone.
- Define the schema, source-authority rules, scoring model, graph state, retry policy,
  and data-retention policy only when explicitly requested by later milestones.
- Revisit generated-artifact paths when concrete LangGraph, LangSmith, Mem0, and
  Streamlit persistence choices are introduced.
